1.Projects Custom Post Type

	In the Dashboard of your WordPress website, You will see a non-default post type called "Projects". You can upload your projects here which will display in the widget section of this plugin. Remember to upload a Featured Image before publishing your projects.

2. CPT Widget

	Under Appearance > Widget, There is a newly available widget called "Latest Projects". You can drag this into your sidebar or other widget areas and it will display 4 of the projects published under the "Projects" custom post type.

3. Cursive Shortcode
	
	The Cursive shortcode changes all the content within the shortcode to display with a cursive font rather than the theme's default font. This is useful to stylize signatures at the end of posts. An example of its use in the text editor looks like this:

	[cursfont] Your Text Here [/cursfont] 

	If you want to change the font a different font-family you need $fontfam in the shortcode. The following will change the content to arial font:

	[cursfont fontfam="Arial, sans-serif"] Your Text Here [/cursfont]
